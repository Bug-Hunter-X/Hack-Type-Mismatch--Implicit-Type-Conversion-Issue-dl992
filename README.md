This repository demonstrates a subtle type mismatch bug in Hack. The code functions correctly when using integers, but fails when using floats due to implicit type conversion issues. The bug is that the function foo is expecting an integer, but if we pass it a float the type error will occur. The solution involves explicitly casting the float to an integer or modifying the function signature to accept floats.
